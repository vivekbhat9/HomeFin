Financial software for home users

#Why
_*How is this different than other financial software*_
This is basically a home financial software. Atleast we are starting from that. So in addition to the normal entry of transactions we will also be linking that to the actual grocery purchased. So instead of getting a very high level analysis of where the money is being spent, like groceries, travel, dining out, this software will be analyzing how much are we spending on rice, flour, getting a coffee at Starbucks, etc. 
1. This can in turn enable us to predict when we need to buy extra stock. So if I am buying rice after every 2 weeks or a month, I can get a reminder before that. 

2. Also this will help me to predict (to some level), how much savings I can expect, at the start of
 month, depending on my previous spending habits. 

3. Other thing that can be implemented is tracking of refundable transactions. E.g. I make a purchase of x amount from some place/site. Due to any reason I have to cancel that whole transaction or part of it. I should be able to mark that transaction(or part of it) as refundable and also set a date by which the refunds should be credited back. If there are no refunds by that date, or the refund doesn't match, I should be getting an alert. 

4. Yes, directly importing transactions from bank is the best way. But that would be a complex process, because some banks may provide easy to import data set like qif, csv or excel sheets. But mapping all that data would be a tedious process. Getting in qif or like format should be the best way, but how many banks provide such facility. 

5. Also for pt 4 above, should the process be manual or automatic. Again depends on the bank. 

6. For each month I should be getting how much change in my assests are there.
